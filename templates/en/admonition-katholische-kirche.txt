Hello,

On {request_date}, I made a request to you according to ยง {article} KDG.

Unfortunately, I have not yet received an answer from you. This means that the period of one month according to ยง 14 Paragraph 3 Sentence 1 KDG has been exceeded.

I am therefore addressing you again and ask you to answer my request within two weeks of receiving this reminder. Otherwise I reserve the right to take legal action against you and to file a complaint with the responsible data protection supervisory authority.

Thanks and Regards
